Now that you've made a change, lets look at the history of the repository. Run
`git log` to be shown all of the commits in the current branch. Each commit
looks something like this:

        commit f1db20ca0f0bdad39ccf473f3afc6e40dcf6df8e
        Author: Ayman El Didi <ayman@eldidi.org>
        Date:   Mon Feb 6 00:01:27 2023 -0700

            initial commit

It shows the author of the commit, the date it was made, and the message at the
bottom. The thing at the top labeled "commit" is a hash which uniquely
identifies the commit.

You can press the up and down arrows to scroll, and q to exit.

To go back to another commit and make changes, run `git checkout hash .` where
hash is the commit hash for the commit you want to go to. Don't forget that .
at the end, it's important.

To get back to the latest commit when you're done, run
`git checkout branchname`.

Go back to some random commit and make a change.
