Last part: Github
-----------------

Now we're gonna see how merging our changes into another branch works. This
will usually be `main`, so that's what we're gonna use here.

Go to Github, and click `branches`, then click `New pull request` beside your
branch's name.

Make the pull request and try to merge it. I'll help you guys with this in
person.

Just so I don't forget for tomorrow:

```
git checkout branchname
git merge main
```

This **should** be everything you'll need for the project. I can teach you guys
more advanced stuff, but that's only if you want.
